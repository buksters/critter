# Critter
*An anthropomorphic timer that can express and defend itself.*

Our society is one of mass production and mass waste, which is destroying the planet. How do we get consumers to care more about increasing the life span of their material goods when words aren't enough? To change the mindset of objects being disposable and replaceable? ...What if objects were self-preserving?

## How Critter Works

I initially envisioned Critter as an alarm clock, which would act like any other clock until its alarm goes off. Critter's head, which functions as a snooze button, contains a distance sensor that measures how far away a hand is and how fast it's coming down. If the hand is approaching too quickly, Critter reacts by retracting its head into its body, causing the hand to hit its hard, spiky shell. Alternatively, one could avoid the pain by approaching Critter's head slowly and gently tapping the button to turn off the alarm.
