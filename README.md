# Critter
*A skittish timer that serves as a playful (and possibly painful) reminder to be gentle.*

Alarms are annoying. But does that justify our anger towards alarm clocks, and the satisfaction we get from slamming down on their snooze buttons in the morning, when they're just trying to do their jobs? What if an alarm clock could fight back - or at least, defend itself? That was the thought process behind Critter: the self-protective timer.

## How Critter Works

I initially envisioned Critter as an alarm clock, which would act like any other clock until its alarm goes off. Critter's head, which functions as a snooze button, contains a distance sensor that measures how far away a hand is and how fast it's coming down. If the hand is approaching too quickly, Critter reacts by retracting its head into its body, causing the hand to hit its hard, spiky shell. Alternatively, one could avoid the pain by approaching Critter's head slowly and gently tapping the button to turn off the alarm.
